# MyHoneyPot
A lightweight Bash honeypot for Ubuntu that launches simulated listeners on common service ports. Each listener mimics real protocol banners to appear legitimate under Nmap scans, logs all connection details, and auto-manages firewall rules. Includes per-port handlers and an installer script.
